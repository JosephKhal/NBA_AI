# NBA_AI
Using Generative AI tools to explain and predict the outcomes of NBA games.

# TODO LIST
- Create installation and setup instructions (Try to make as much of this a script as possible)
    - How to pull down from Github
    - How to perform initial setup including downlaoding any extra materials like database or models.
    - How to update environment from requirements.txt
    - How to determine the project root
    - How to create and update .env file and set contents
    - Determine any other initial setup instructions
- Create usage instructions (Try to make a visuals. Gif preferably)
    - How to initiate the app
    - How to choose a predictor
    - How to navigate the app
- Instructions for improving or adding to the app
    - Creating new predictors
    - Improving the core code
    - Contibution Guide
    - Future Additions (New prediction engines)
- Notes on current performance
    - Performance of the prediction systems
    - Performance of the web app
- Graph of MAE of home margin and total comparing the prediction engines to baselines
    - Simple Baseline
        - For total this is the sum of the home teams average ppg and the away teams average ppg from that point in the season
        - For home margin this is home average net ppg - away average net ppg

- 
- Determine how to package 2023-2024 version on data, teams.json, and models to be hosted on Github
- Create documentation for the various modules and functions that explain what they do and how they fit together.

# Project Overview

## Project Goal

## Project Philosophy on the scale from NBA Betting (High Data Collection Effort) to Future goals of minimal data collection effort focusing on foundational data sets like play by play, tracking, and video. Talk a little about the tradeoffs between the types of data soruces. Consider the scale from high human intervention to low on both data collection and predicting
