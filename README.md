## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a minimal process for predicting the outcomes of NBA games. The minimal goal is in contrast to the comprehensive goal effort of my previous project, [NBA Betting]() and is an attempt to work away from the high complexity and high human effort required for a typical data science project and towards a method where AI does the heavy lifting requiring lower human intervention. As this project progresses, it should get simpler instead of more complex by decreasing the amount of data collection and processing required. 

## Installation and Setup
Instructions on how to install and setup the project will be provided here.

## Prediction Engines
This section will discuss the current prediction engine with a graph and future GenAI based prediction engine.

## Notes
This section will provide notes on performance, why this is a repo and not a website, and on data sourcing and collection. We will mention swar nba and sportsdataverse/hoopr.

## Contact Info
Please feel free to contact us with any questions.

## Future Additions
- Create a GenAI based prediction engine
- Consolidate betting data into database
